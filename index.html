        <p>Down the street you can hear her scream</p>
        <p>You're a disgrace as she slams the door</p>
        <p>In his drunken face And now he stands outside</p>
        <p>He cries oh girl you must be mad</p>
        <p>What happened to the sweet love you and me had</p>
        <p>Against the door he leans and start a scene</p>
        <p>And his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>
        <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
        <p> Fall in the sea Eventually</p>
        <p>A little Indian brave who before he was ten</p>
        <p>Played wargames in the woods with his Indian friends</p>
        <p> And he built a dream that when he grew up</p>
        <p>He would be a fearless warrior Indian chief</p>
        <p>Many moons past and more the dream grew strong</p>
        <p>Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song</p>
        <p>And fight his first battle</p>
        <p>But something went wrong</p>
         <p>Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night</p>
         <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
         <p>Fall in the sea Eventually</p>
         <p>There was a young girl</p>
         <p>Whose heart was a frown</p>
         <p>'Cause she was crippled for life</p>
         <p>And she couldn't speak a sound</p>
         <p>And she wished and prayed</p>
         <p>She could stop livin'</p>
         <p> So she decide to die</p>
         <p> She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore</p>
         <p>And to her legs she smiled</p>
         <p>You won't hurt me no more</p>
         <p>But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say</p>
         <p>Look a golden winged ship is passing my way</p>
         <p>And it really didn't have to stop</p>
         <p> It just kept on going And so castles made of sand</p>
        </p>Slips into the sea Eventually</p>
